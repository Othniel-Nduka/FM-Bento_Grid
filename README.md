## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that I'm better off using css grid-template-areas than the grid-row and grid-column properties. It is way more easire for me, although it'll still take some time to get used to it. But I'm better off with that.



### Continued development

I would say that I would continue to use grids in the future alongside flexbox, I'm fascinated by grids though I don't use it often and I wonder, with some things I have seen on react I would like to think that they are similar in structure.



### Useful resources

- [Become A Master Grid CSS in 13 Minutes](https://www.example.com) - This really helped me in better understanding the concepts of grid-templates and how they work.
